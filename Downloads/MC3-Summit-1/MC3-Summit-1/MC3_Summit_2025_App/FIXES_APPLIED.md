# MC3 Summit 2025 - Errors Fixed üõ†Ô∏è

## Summary of Issues Resolved

This document outlines all the errors that were identified and fixed in the MC3 Summit 2025 web application.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Chart Canvas Elements**
- **Problem**: JavaScript was looking for `povertyEducationChart` and `familyStabilityChart` but these canvas elements didn't exist in `index.html`
- **Solution**: Added proper chart canvas elements with correct IDs in the main index page
- **Files Modified**: `MC3_Summit_2025_App/index.html`

### 2. **Hidden Canvas Elements Preventing Chart Rendering**
- **Problem**: Most chart canvas elements had `style="display: none;"` which prevented Chart.js from rendering properly
- **Solution**: Removed `display: none` styles from all chart canvas elements across all pages
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/pages/education.html`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/pages/economy.html`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/pages/social-services.html`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/pages/correlations.html`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/pages/demographics.html`

### 3. **Missing Chart Initialization Methods**
- **Problem**: JavaScript was calling chart initialization methods that didn't exist:
  - `initializeEducationCharts()`
  - `initializeEconomyCharts()`
  - `initializeSocialServicesCharts()`
  - `initializeCorrelationCharts()`
- **Solution**: Added all missing chart initialization methods and their corresponding chart creation methods
- **Files Modified**: `MC3_Summit_2025_App/js/visualizations.js`

### 4. **Empty Data Directory**
- **Problem**: `data/processed/` directory was empty, which could cause data loading errors
- **Solution**: Created sample data files with proper JSON structure
- **Files Created**:
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/data/processed/demographics.json`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/data/processed/education.json`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/data/processed/economy.json`
  - `MC3_Summit_2025_App/data/processed/social-services.json`
